				<h4>What is this app?</h4>
				<div>
					<div class="item">This is a system that records the work of a
						PhD candidate in the department where they are studying. In each
						semester they will be assigned a project in 3 categories:
						laboratory teaching, supervising and test corrections. They should
						receive a total of 80 work points with the following measurement:
						laboratory teaching (1 hour = 1 point), supervising (1 hour = 1
						point), tests correction (5 tests = 1 point). A combination of
						these may be assigned to them, which the supervisor assigns in
						consultation with the general assembly. The secretarial department
						monitors the process and validates the offer hours / points.</div>
